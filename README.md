### Technical Background
The project I worked on was a backend development project for an e-commerce customer. The project's purpose was to create a reliable and scalable backend system to support the client's online business. The backend system has to handle a huge number of concurrent users while also processing transactions, managing user data, and providing real-time inventory updates.
Technologies Used:
I was primarily involved in backend development, and the technologies I worked with included:

* Programming Languages: I used a combination of programming languages, such as Python, Java, and SQL, to build various components of the backend system.

* Database: We utilized a relational database management system (RDBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store and manage the data efficiently.

* Web Frameworks: Frameworks like Django (for Python) or Spring Boot (for Java) were used to build the web services and APIs that the frontend and mobile applications would interact with.

* API Development: I was responsible for designing and implementing RESTful APIs that allowed communication between the frontend and backend systems.

 => My Experience:

* Learning Curve: Working as a fresher, the learning curve was steep, but the company provided a structured onboarding process and training programs. I learned about software development best practices, coding standards, and version control systems like Git.

* Teamwork: Collaboration was a significant part of my experience. I worked closely with experienced developers, senior engineers, and project managers who provided guidance and mentorship. Team meetings and code reviews were regular occurrences, helping me improve my coding skills.

* Problem Solving: I encountered various challenges during the project, such as optimizing database queries for better performance, handling data synchronization, and ensuring data security. These challenges allowed me to develop problem-solving skills and learn from real-world scenarios.

* Project Management: I got exposure to project management tools and methodologies, which helped in organizing tasks, tracking progress, and meeting deadlines.
  
 Overall, my experience as a fresher at Tata Elxsi Limited was both challenging and rewarding. It provided me with the opportunity to work on a real-world project, collaborate with experienced professionals, and develop the technical and soft skills necessary for a successful career in software development.
